# VoiceCoder

An open source voice coding system written in Dragonfly.

This software is and always will remain open source. RSI is a hugely overlooked
issue in software development. I hope that this helps other developers who need
a break from typing.

# License

GPLv3 on all code unless explicitly stated otherwise.

# Credit

This set of tools is only possible by the generous contributions of many other
opensource developers.

# VoiceCoder: Protect your Career and your Hands! 
VoiceCoder is an open source and free set of macros for Dragonfly.  Ultimately,
this system will allow one to code primarily with voice commands.

This software is and always will remain open source. RSI is a hugely overlooked
issue in software development. I believe that this project will one day bring
benefit to many people. Until then, I will continue to develop this software.

# License

GPLv3 on all code unless explicitly stated otherwise.

# Credit

This set of tools is only possible by the generous contributions of many other
opensource developers.
